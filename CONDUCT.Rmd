Our team has decided to use the 'UofT Coders Code of Conduct' for this specific project. Additionally, we agree to meet twice a week during regular lecture sessions to work on this project. Extra meetings will be held when necessary. To speack of the PR approval policy, when a group member makes changes in the branch, we make sure that every team member reviews them and agree with the PR message by thumbing it up before changes are merged. The last group member will approve the pull request. Last but not the least, we all agree that for the first two weeks, Xueqian will be our Leader, Yani will be our Recorder, and Xinji will be our Organizer. Role rotations will be made since the third week, with Yani as the leader. Xinji will be the leader for the last week.
