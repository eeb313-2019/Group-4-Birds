Pseudo-figure captions:

- Figure 1. A scatter plot showing an overall declining trend with minor fluctuations in the population abundance measured by mean counts from 1991 to 2015. The graph is generated from simulated data.

- Figure 2 (1998-2015, in the 'Population trend' folder). Due to insufficient data from 1991 to 1997, only 18 scatter plots are produced to show daily counts of Western Sandpiper during the migration period from 1998 to 2015.

- Figure 3a. A scatter plot showing changes in mean temperature during Western Sandpiper's migration period over 25 years. The graph is generated from simulated data.

- Figure 3b. A scatter plot showing changes in mean precipitation during Western Sandpiper's migration period over 25 years. The graph is generated from simulated data.

- Figure 4. A scatter plot showing peak dates over 25 years from simulated data.
