Pseudo-figure captions:

- Figure 1. A scatter plot showing an overall declining trend with minor fluctuations in the population abundance measured by mean counts from 1991 to 2015. The graph is generated from simulated data.

- Figure 2 (1998-2015, in the 'Population trend' folder). Due to insufficient data from 1991 to 1997, only 18 scatter plots are produced to show daily counts of Western Sandpiper during the migration period from 1998 to 2015.

  Note: the trend shown by these figures is not consistent with our prediction (i.e. the distribution will gradually shift to the left with year)

- Figure 3a. A scatter plot showing an overall increasing trend in the mean temperature with minor fluctuations during Western Sandpiper's migration period over 25 years. The graph is generated from simulated data.

- Figure 3b. A scatter plot showing an overall increasing trend in the mean precipitation with fluctuations during Western Sandpiper's migration period over 25 years. The graph is generated from simulated data.

- Figure 4. A scatter plot showing overall advanced peak dates over 25 years from simulated data.
