# Possible analyses

- To investigate whether the population abundance changes over the years, we calculate the mean daily counts of Western Sandpiper 
  during the migration period for 24 years. We then do a regression test between year and mean daily counts.
  Data manipulation: 


- Does the population abundance trend vary each year?
- How do temperature and precipitation change? 
- Is temperature and precipitation correlated at the study site?
- Which day does population abundance peak for each year?
- How does the peak vary over the years? 
- Does the daily local temperature and precipitation predict daily Western Sandpiper observation counts?




# Possible results tables
Predictions:

Over the years, during the migration period (15 April - 15 May):

- We predict that mean population abundance will decrease.
- We predict a normal distribution at the very first few years, and the distribution will shift and be a little bit right-skewed over the years.
- We predict that both temperature and precipitation will show an increasing trend. 
- We predict that temperature and precipitation will be correlated at the study site.
- We predict that the date at which the daily count peaks will be advanced.
- We predict that an increase in local temperature and precipitation will result in an increase in the daily Western Sandpiper observation counts.
