# Study objectives

Questions:

Over the years, during the migration period (15 April - 15 May):

- How does the mean population abundance change?
- Does the population abundance trend vary each year?
- How do temperature and precipitation change? 
- Is temperature and precipitation correlated at the study site?
- Which day does population abundance peak for each year?
- How does the peak vary over the years? 
- Does the daily local temperature and precipitation predict daily Western Sandpiper observation counts?

Predictions:

Over the years, during the migration period (15 April - 15 May):

- We predict that mean population abundance will decrease.
- We predict a normal distribution at the very first few years, and the distribution will shift and be a little bit right-skewed over the years.
- We predict that both temperature and precipitation will show an increasing trend. 
- We predict that temperature and precipitation will be correlated at the study site.
- We predict that the date at which the daily count peaks will be advanced.
- We predict that an increase in local temperature and precipitation will result in an increase in the daily Western Sandpiper observation counts.
