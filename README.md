# Group-4-Birds


# Introduction to the project

- One paragraph, answering: 

- What is your project about?

- What is the goal? 

- Why are you doing it?

  All of our group members are specifically interested in bird species and conservation. We understand the current anthropogenic environmental crisis and we are curious about how climate change will affect migratory birds, especially their migration dates. We are to plot out the bird migration data to figure out their potential threats to give insights for future conservation efforts.
  
  

# Description of the data

- What is the data about?

- What are the variables to be used? 

- How was data collected? 

  Our data was obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) web site. According to the BBS Overview Article, the data was collected by very motivated birders, who all have fair experience on bird identification to assist in monitering and discoverying bird population trends on various surveyed route.

- How it will answer your research questions?

- Include a reference of the dataset if one is available, for instance:

            Forstmann BU, et al. (2014) Data from: Multi-modal ultra-high resolution
            structural 7-Tesla MRI data repository. Dryad Digital Repository.

  Yani Fang: a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in biodiversity & conservation, minoring in environmental biology and environmental studies. Easy-going, can solve disputes among group members, have basic understanding on evolution and human-induced effects on biodiversity, and know a little bit programming. May help with plotting and buiding models.
  
  Xinji Zhao: a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in biodiversity & conservation biology, minoring in statistics. I'm able to analyze the data and graph based on my statistic knowledge, prefer jobs after coding.

- How will team roles be rotated?

  We will have Xueqian Ma to be our leader for the first two weeks to help us get a fresh start and brainstorm with relavent ideas. Yani Fang will be our team leader for the third week, monitering the process of data analysi. Xinji Zhao will be our team leader for the final week, whose responsibility is mainly on the organization of our results and preparation of the PPT presentation.
