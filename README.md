# Group-4-Birds


# Introduction to the project

  As a response to the evident climate change, some organisms have altered their behavior, morphology and physiology. For migratory birds, changes in local climatic conditions (such as temperature and precipitation) may predict a shift in their migration dates. Studies on effects of climate change on Ontario migratory birds have been done and well analyzed, and we are wondering if Western Sandpiper (*Calidris mauri*), a long-term migratory species which passes through coastal British Columbia as a stopover site, shows similar trends. We are to plot out the migration timing when most of the birds have arrived against the stopover sites' local temperature and precipitation from 1991-2015 and see whether the local climate predicts the migration timing. We want to do this analysis because all of our group members are specifically interested in bird diversity and conservation, and would like to better understand the current anthropogenic environmental crisis.
  

# Description of the data

  We obtained the Western Sandpiper abundance data from the Roberts Bank Shorebird Survey conducted in BC by Environment and Climate Change, Government of Canada. The researchers surveyed species-specific abundance of two shorebird species, Western Sandpiper (*Calidris mauri*) and Dunlin (*Calidris alpina*) during their migration period (April-May) from 1991 to 2015 at Roberts Bank's mudflat. The daily counts started from April 15 each year till bird abundance <1000 or May 15, whichever came first.  
  
  We also selected datasets for daily temperature and precipitation in Delta Tsawwassen Beach, BC for years from 1991-2015. These historical climate datasets were obtained from the Daily Data Report produced by Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Government of Canada. Specialized scientists recorded the hourly climatological data at observing stations, using instruments such as satellites and weather balloons and others. The Delta Tsawwassen Beach was the closest site to the given coordinates where the actual bird abundance survey was conducted, and this site contained sufficient climate data (i.e. having data for the targeted time intervals).  
  
  Our response variable will be the migration timing indicated by the daily counts of Western Sandpiper in costal BC from April to May, 1991-2015 and our predictor variables may include daily temperature and precipitation from April to May 1991-2015. By exploring the relationship between these variables, we can gain some insights about the impacts of climate change on *potential shifts* of their migration dates.

# Team description

  Xueqian Ma: a fourth-year EEB specialist. Passionate about animal diversity and animal behavior. Comfortable with statistics and programming. Will assist in data manipulation, plotting, and statistical analysis.
  
  Yani Fang: a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in biodiversity & conservation, minoring in environmental biology and environmental studies. Easy-going, can solve disputes among group members, have a basic understanding of evolution and human-induced effects on biodiversity, and know a little bit of programming. May help with plotting and building models.
  
  Xinji Zhao: a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in biodiversity & conservation biology, minoring in statistics. I'm able to analyze the data and graph based on my statistic knowledge, prefer jobs after coding.
  
  We will have Xueqian Ma to be our leader for the first two weeks to help us get a fresh start and brainstorm with relevant ideas. Yani Fang will be our team leader for the third week, monitoring the process of data analysis. Xinji Zhao will be our team leader for the final week, whose responsibility is mainly on the organization of our results and preparation of the PPT presentation. We prefer that Yani will be our Recorder and Xinji as our Organiser, for now, later changes can be applied if that is better.
