# Introduction to the project

- One paragraph, answering: 

- What is your project about?

  Owing to the evident climate change, migratory birds are experiencing a rapid decline in their abundances. Studies on effects of climate change on Ontario migratory bird has been done and well analyzed, and we are wondering if species in the western coast show the similar trends.

- What is the goal? 

   We are to plot out some migratory bird species abundance data and compare differences in migration dates on a 20-years interval to figure out the potential threats to give insights for future conservation efforts.

- Why are you doing it?

  All of our group members are specifically interested in bird species and conservation. We understand the current anthropogenic environmental crisis and we are curious about how climate change will affect migratory birds, especially their population abundances and migration dates. 
  
  

# Description of the data

- What is the data about?

- What are the variables to be used? 

- How was data collected? 

  Our data was obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) web site. According to the BBS Overview Article, the data was collected by very motivated birders, who all have fair experience on bird identification to assist in monitering and discoverying bird population trends on various surveyed route.

- How it will answer your research questions?

- Include a reference of the dataset if one is available, for instance:

# Team description

- Brief biography of each member (what are their skills and approximate responsibilities)
  
  Xueqian Ma: a fourth-year EEB specialist. Passionate about animal diversity and animal behavior. Comfortable with statistics and programming. Will assist in data manipulation, plotting and statistical analysis.
  
  Yani Fang: a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in biodiversity & conservation, minoring in environmental biology and environmental studies. Easy-going, can solve disputes among group members, have basic understanding on evolution and human-induced effects on biodiversity, and know a little bit programming. May help with plotting and buiding models.
  
  Xinji Zhao: a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in biodiversity & conservation biology, minoring in statistics. I'm able to analyze the data and graph based on my statistic knowledge, prefer jobs after coding.

- How will team roles be rotated?

  We will have Xueqian Ma to be our leader for the first two weeks to help us get a fresh start and brainstorm with relavent ideas. Yani Fang will be our team leader for the third week, monitering the process of data analysi. Xinji Zhao will be our team leader for the final week, whose responsibility is mainly on the organization of our results and preparation of the PPT presentation. We prefer that Yani will be our Recorder and Xinji as our Organiser for now, later changes can be applied if that is better.
